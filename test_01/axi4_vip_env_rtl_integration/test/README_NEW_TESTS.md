echo "axi4_comprehensive_burst_test" > regression.list
echo "axi4_4kb_boundary_test" >> regression.list  
echo "axi4_exclusive_access_test" >> regression.list
echo "axi4_protocol_compliance_test" >> regression.list
echo "axi4_advanced_error_test" >> regression.list
echo "axi4_multi_master_contention_test" >> regression.list
echo "axi4_data_integrity_test" >> regression.list

## Debugging and Analysis

### Waveform Analysis
- Use `+enable_wave` to capture waveforms
- Focus on channel handshakes during protocol violations
- Monitor arbitration signals during contention tests
- Check data integrity during burst operations

### Log Analysis
- Search for "ERROR" or "FATAL" messages
- Monitor UVM_INFO messages for test progress
- Check for assertion failures in protocol compliance
- Verify transaction completion counts

### Performance Analysis
- Monitor transaction throughput in contention tests
- Check latency measurements in performance tests
- Analyze bandwidth utilization across masters
- Verify QoS arbitration effectiveness

## Known Limitations

1. **Simulation Performance**: Large burst tests may take significant simulation time
2. **Memory Requirements**: Data integrity tests require substantial memory models
3. **Platform Dependencies**: Some timing-sensitive tests may vary on different simulators
4. **Coverage Dependencies**: Full coverage requires specific RTL implementation features

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion:

- AXI4-Lite specific scenarios  
- Power management interface testing
- Cross-clock domain scenarios
- Advanced coherency protocols
- SystemVerilog assertions integration
