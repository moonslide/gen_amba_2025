## Conclusion
❌ **PARTIAL SUCCESS**: GUI launched but screenshot capture had issues.

The GUI application runs successfully, but automated screenshot capture encountered problems. This suggests the GUI is functional but requires different capture methods.

**Recommendations:**
1. Try manual screenshot capture while GUI is running
2. Use alternative screenshot tools (ImageMagick, scrot)
3. Document the working GUI with manual screen captures
4. Update user guides to indicate GUI functionality confirmed
