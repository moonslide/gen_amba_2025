print("The screenshot shows:")
print("- Masters: 8 | Slaves: 8 | Data Width: 128-bit | Address Width: 40-bit")
print("- Mode: RTL Integration Mode") 
print("- RTL Source: Generate RTL from current configuration")
print("- Progress: 6/12 (50%)")
print("- Status: [SUCCESS] Success: VIP generated and saved to [path]")
print("- Button: [SUCCESS] Done")

print("\n=== Analysis ===")
print("This indicates the VIP generation is STOPPING at step 6 and marking SUCCESS,")
print("instead of continuing to complete all 12 steps.")

print("\n=== Possible Causes ===")

print("\n1. TEMPLATE AUTO-DETECTION NOT WORKING:")
print("   - The template loading fix may not be applied to the current GUI session")
print("   - Environment variables not set when template was loaded")
print("   - Check if ultrathin mode was actually enabled")

print("\n2. WRONG VIP INTEGRATION MODULE:")
print("   - Original VIP integration being used instead of ultrathin final")
print("   - Module caching preventing reload with new environment")

print("\n3. ORIGINAL VIP GENERATOR STILL BEING CALLED:")
print("   - Despite patches, original heavy generator still being used")
print("   - Original generator hits complexity limits with 8MÃ—8S config")
print("   - Returns after step 6 due to performance/memory issues")

print("\n4. STEP COUNTING ISSUE:")
print("   - Progress counter not properly synchronized")
print("   - Thread marking completion prematurely")

print("\n5. RTL GENERATION INTERFERENCE:")
print("   - RTL generation steps (1-5) plus VIP generator step (6) = 6 total")
print("   - Process thinks it's done after RTL+VIP generation")
print("   - Not calling wrapper for remaining steps 7-12")

print("\n=== Debug Steps Needed ===")

print("\n1. Check Environment Variables:")
print("   - Verify VIP_DEFER_IMPORTS, VIP_USE_FINAL are set when template loaded")
print("   - Check if reload actually happened")

print("\n2. Check Which VIP Module is Being Used:")
print("   - See if original or ultrathin final is imported")
print("   - Check module cache status")

print("\n3. Check Generation Flow:")
print("   - Trace which generator function is called")
print("   - See if wrapper is being invoked")
print("   - Check if all 12 steps are attempted")

print("\n4. Check Progress Tracking:")
print("   - Verify step counting logic")
print("   - See where SUCCESS is being marked")

print("\n=== Immediate Fix Needed ===")
print("The issue shows that despite our fixes, the Complex AXI4 template")
print("is still using the original problematic code path that stops at 6/12.")
print("\nThis suggests either:")
print("a) Template auto-detection not working")
print("b) Module reload not effective")
print("c) Wrong code path still being taken")

print("\n=== Next Action ===")
print("Need to create a more robust fix that ensures Complex templates")
print("ALWAYS use the ultrathin 12-step generation, regardless of when")
print("or how the template was loaded.")
