# Complex AXI4 Template Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Overlapping Connection Lines
- **Problem**: All connection lines from masters/slaves to the interconnect were drawn at the same Y coordinate, causing severe overlap
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented distributed connection points on the interconnect
  - Each master/slave gets a unique Y position on the interconnect edge
  - Added multi-segment routing with bends to avoid overlaps:
    - Master â†’ Midpoint (horizontal)
    - Midpoint â†’ Connection point (vertical)
    - Connection point â†’ Interconnect (horizontal with arrow)
  - Similar routing for slaves in reverse

### 2. Fixed Interconnect Position
- **Problem**: Interconnect was at fixed x=375, not adapting to actual component layout
- **Solution**:
  - Calculate dynamic position based on rightmost master and leftmost slave
  - Interconnect width adjusts to span the gap properly
  - Minimum width of 200 pixels to ensure router component fits

### 3. Unicode Character Error
- **Problem**: Lock emoji (ðŸ”’) caused TclError on systems that don't support Unicode above U+FFFF
- **Solution**: Replaced emoji with text indicator "[SEC]" in dark red for secure-only slaves

### 4. Better Error Handling
- **Solution**: Added detailed error reporting with stack traces in:
  - `load_template()` method
  - `refresh_ui()` method
  - Error details shown in both message box and console

## Layout Improvements

### Master Layout (3x3 grid):
```
M0  M1  M2     (Row 1: CPU clusters, GPU)
M3  M4  M5     (Row 2: Video/DMA engines)
M6  M7  --     (Row 3: DMA, PCIe)
```

### Slave Layout (3x3 grid):
```
S0  S1  S2     (Row 1: DDR channels, L3 cache)
S3  S4  S5     (Row 2: ROM, Registers, PCIe)
S6  S7  --     (Row 3: Crypto, Debug)
```

### Connection Routing:
- Each master has a unique connection point on the left edge of interconnect
- Each slave has a unique connection point on the right edge
- Connections use orthogonal routing (horizontal-vertical-horizontal) to avoid overlaps
- Labels show Master ID + Priority (e.g., "M0 P:15") and Slave ID (e.g., "S0")

## Testing
The Complex AXI4 System template now loads successfully with:
- 8 Masters with priorities ranging from 7-15
- 8 Slaves with various security settings
- Proper spacing and no overlapping lines
- Clear visual hierarchy and connection routing
