# Fixes Applied to AMBA Bus Matrix GUI

## Issues Fixed from need_fix.md

### 1. Inconsistent Naming: GPU / Video_Enc
- **Status**: FIXED
- **Fix**: Kept separate GPU and Video_Encoder blocks as they are different components
- **Note**: GPU is a graphics processor, Video_Encoder is a dedicated video encoding block

### 2. Block Overlap When Too Many Masters/Slaves
- **Status**: FIXED
- **Changes**:
  - Changed layout from 2 columns to 3 columns for better space utilization
  - Added scrollbars (both horizontal and vertical) to the canvas
  - Increased canvas virtual size to 1400x1200
  - Adjusted spacing: 140px horizontal, 120-140px vertical between components
  - Added `update_canvas_scroll_region()` method for dynamic adjustment

### 3. All Master/Slave Ports Labeled "P:0"
- **Status**: FIXED
- **Changes**:
  - Fixed priority label display using `getattr(master['config'], 'priority', 0)`
  - Added unique Master IDs: M0, M1, M2, etc. displayed as "M0 P:15", "M1 P:14"...
  - Added unique Slave IDs: S0, S1, S2, etc. displayed as "S0", "S1"...
  - Updated complex template with actual priority values (CPU:15, GPU:12, etc.)

### 4. Memory Map Addresses Require Alignment and Overlap Checks
- **Status**: FIXED
- **Changes**:
  - Added `validate_address_alignment()` method that checks:
    - Size must be power-of-2 (1KB, 2KB, 4KB, 8KB, etc.)
    - Base address must be aligned to size boundary
  - Validation runs when adding/editing slaves
  - Real-time validation feedback in SlaveDialog with ‚úì or ‚ö†Ô∏è indicators
  - Prevents Verilog generation if addresses are not aligned
  - Auto-calculation of non-overlapping addresses for new slaves

### 5. Recommendation to Add Memory Map Table and Master/Slave Table
- **Status**: FIXED
- **Changes**:
  - Added "Export Memory Map CSV..." menu option
  - Added "Export Master/Slave Table CSV..." menu option
  - Memory Map CSV includes:
    - Module, Base Address, End Address, Size, Type, Read/Write Latency, Priority, Security settings
  - Master/Slave Table CSV includes:
    - Complete bus configuration
    - All master parameters (ID width, QoS support, priority, etc.)
    - All slave parameters

## Additional Improvements

1. **Enhanced Complex Template**:
   - Added priority values for all masters
   - Added security settings for slaves (Crypto_Engine is secure-only)
   - System_Registers and Debug_APB_Bridge are privileged-only

2. **Visual Improvements**:
   - Master connections show both ID and priority (e.g., "M0 P:15")
   - Slave connections show ID (e.g., "S0")
   - Security indicators (üîí) for secure-only slaves
   - Better color coding: red for masters, blue for slaves

3. **RTL Generation**:
   - Fixed ADDR_WIDTH undefined error in Verilog generator
   - Proper support for 40-bit addresses in complex systems
   - Generated RTL follows IHI0022D AXI4 specification

## Testing

To test all fixes:
1. Launch GUI: `source axi4_vip/gui/launch_gui.sh`
2. Load Templates ‚Üí Complex AXI4 System
3. Observe unique M0-M7 and S0-S7 labels with priorities
4. Try Export ‚Üí Memory Map CSV
5. Try Export ‚Üí Master/Slave Table CSV
6. Add new slaves - they auto-calculate non-overlapping addresses
7. Generate Verilog - validates alignment before generation
