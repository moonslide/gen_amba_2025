# Continuous Slow Flash Feature

## Overview
The flash effect now continues throughout the entire drag operation with a slower, more visible pulsing effect.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Continuous Flashing
- **Before**: Single flash sequence when clicked
- **Now**: Continuous pulsing during entire drag operation
- Flash loops until drag ends or user clicks elsewhere

### 2. Slower Animation
- **Speed**: 200ms per color (2x slower than before)
- **Full cycle**: 1.2 seconds
- **Visual effect**: Smooth, gentle pulsing

### 3. Color Sequence
```
1. Light Yellow (#FFFF99)     ← Subtle highlight
2. Lighter Yellow (#FFFFCC)   ← Getting brighter
3. White (#FFFFFF)            ← Peak brightness
4. Lighter Yellow (#FFFFCC)   ← Fading back
5. Light Yellow (#FFFF99)     ← Almost original
6. Original Color             ← Brief return to normal
→ Repeat from step 1...
```

## When Flash Starts
- Left-click on any master or slave block
- Begins immediately when drag starts

## When Flash Stops
- **Mouse release**: Stop dragging
- **Right-click**: Opens context menu
- **Click empty space**: Deselects block
- **Grid snap**: When snapping completes

## Implementation Details

### Flash State Tracking
```python
self.flashing_block = (block_id, original_color)  # Currently flashing
self.flash_after_id = None  # Timer ID for cancellation
```

### Continuous Loop
```python
def continuous_flash(color_index=0):
    if self.flashing_block and self.flashing_block[0] == block_id:
        self.itemconfig(block_id, fill=flash_colors[color_index])
        next_index = (color_index + 1) % len(flash_colors)
        self.flash_after_id = self.after(flash_duration, 
                                       lambda: continuous_flash(next_index))
```

### Clean Stop
```python
def stop_flash(self):
    # Cancel timer
    if self.flash_after_id:
        self.after_cancel(self.flash_after_id)
    # Restore original color
    if self.flashing_block:
        block_id, original_color = self.flashing_block
        self.itemconfig(block_id, fill=original_color)
```

## Visual Benefits
1. **Clear Feedback**: Obvious which block is being dragged
2. **Professional**: Smooth, not jarring
3. **Accessible**: Slower speed easier to see
4. **Non-intrusive**: Subtle colors don't distract

## User Experience
- Click and drag → Block pulses continuously
- Release → Pulsing stops immediately
- Very clear visual indication of active selection
- Professional, polished interaction
