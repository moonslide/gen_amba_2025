# VIP Compilation Fix

## Issue
When running VCS compilation in the generated VIP environment, the following errors occurred:
1. Environment variable `VIP_ROOT` was not defined
2. RTL file list `rtl_files.f` was missing
3. Missing package and component definitions

## Solution

### 1. VIP_ROOT Environment Variable
- Updated Makefile to export `VIP_ROOT = ..` 
- Modified compile commands to pass VIP_ROOT explicitly: `VIP_ROOT=$(VIP_ROOT) vcs ...`
- This ensures the compile file can resolve all `${VIP_ROOT}` paths

### 2. RTL File List
- Now always creates `rtl_wrapper/rtl_files.f` even if empty
- Prevents "file not found" errors during compilation
- File is auto-populated when using tool-generated RTL

### 3. Complete Package Definitions
Added stub implementations for all required components:

#### Master Package (`axi4_master_pkg`)
- Transaction class (`axi4_master_tx`)
- Agent configuration (`axi4_master_agent_config`)
- Sequencer (`axi4_master_sequencer`)
- Driver (`axi4_master_driver`)
- Monitor (`axi4_master_monitor`)
- Agent (`axi4_master_agent`)

#### Slave Package (`axi4_slave_pkg`)
- Transaction class (`axi4_slave_tx`)
- Agent configuration (`axi4_slave_agent_config`)
- Sequencer (`axi4_slave_sequencer`)
- Driver (`axi4_slave_driver`)
- Monitor (`axi4_slave_monitor`)
- Agent (`axi4_slave_agent`)

#### Additional Components
- Virtual sequencer and sequences
- Environment package with scoreboard and coverage stubs
- Test package with base test and example test
- BFM interface stubs for compilation

## Usage

After generating the VIP environment:

```bash
cd <output_dir>/axi4_vip_env_rtl_integration/sim
make compile
```

The compilation should now succeed without errors. The generated environment includes:
- Proper VIP_ROOT handling
- All required SystemVerilog files
- Stub implementations that can be replaced with actual logic
- Complete package hierarchy following tim_axi4_vip structure

## Next Steps

1. Replace stub BFMs with actual protocol implementations
2. Implement real driver/monitor logic
3. Add protocol-specific sequences
4. Enhance scoreboard for actual checking
5. Add functional coverage points
