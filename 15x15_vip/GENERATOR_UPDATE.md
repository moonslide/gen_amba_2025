# Generator Update for Zero UVM_ERRORs

## Problem Solved
Fixed the remaining UVM_ERROR where Master 2 experienced B-channel timeout due to incorrect BID routing.

## Root Cause
The interconnect was clearing transaction state (transaction_id and w_active) on WLAST, but the B-channel response happens after WLAST. This caused the slave to lose track of which master was waiting for the response.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Transaction ID Tracking
- Added `s*_transaction_id` registers for each slave
- Capture AWID on AW handshake into transaction_id
- Use transaction_id for BID generation

### 2. Correct Timing
- **DON'T** clear transaction_id on WLAST
- **DON'T** clear w_active on WLAST  
- **DO** clear both on B-channel response completion (bvalid && bready)

### 3. Key Code Changes

#### Add registers for each slave:
```verilog
reg [3:0] s0_transaction_id;  // Track AWID through transaction
reg s0_w_active;              // Write channel active
reg [3:0] s0_w_owner;         // Which master owns channel
```

#### Capture ID on AW handshake:
```verilog
if (s0_awready && s0_awvalid) begin
    s0_w_owner <= s0_aw_grant;
    s0_w_active <= 1'b1;
    s0_transaction_id <= s0_awid;  // Capture for BID
end
```

#### Clear on B-channel completion (NOT on WLAST):
```verilog
if (s0_bvalid && s0_bready) begin
    s0_transaction_id <= 4'd0;  // Clear after B response
    s0_w_active <= 1'b0;        // Transaction complete
end
```

#### Use transaction_id for BID:
```verilog
assign s0_bid = s0_w_active ? s0_transaction_id : s0_awid;
```

## Test Results
- **Before Fix**: 1 UVM_ERROR (Master 2 B-channel timeout)
- **After Fix**: 0 UVM_ERRORs âœ…

## Files Modified
- `axi4_interconnect_m15s15.v` - RTL interconnect
- Applied via `fix_transaction_id_timing.py`

## Recommendation for Generator
The gen_amba_axi generator should:
1. Add transaction ID tracking registers for robust B-channel routing
2. Ensure transaction state is held until B-channel completes
3. Not rely on slave BFMs to correctly echo BID values

This fix ensures compatibility with various VIP testbenches that may have different BID generation behaviors.
