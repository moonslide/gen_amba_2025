9x9 VIP REGENERATION COMPLETE
============================

The 9x9_vip directory has been successfully regenerated with all fixes applied.

WHAT WAS FIXED:
- Monitor compilation errors (XMRE, vif access)
- Added comprehensive UVM_INFO logging
- Fixed all cross-module reference errors

HOW TO RUN YOUR TEST:
1. Go to simulation directory:
   cd /home/timtim01/eda_test/project/gen_amba_2025/9x9_vip/axi4_vip_env_rtl_integration/sim

2. Run your exact command:
   make run_fsdb TEST=axi4_basic_rw_test

   OR use the helper script:
   ./run_test_now.sh

The compilation errors are now fixed. The test should compile and run successfully.
